synopsis: good work so far

details:

Good work so far. Good improvements to code and tests. Kudos.

1.

Good

"This approach allowed us to easily mock different criteria results without directly modifying our code." stub instead of mock.

3.

Not quite the Factory Method, we can remove that pattern.
Not a Bridge Pattern, we can remove this.
Not a Strategy Pattern, we can remove this.
This is not really the user of Facade, we can remove this.

That leaves the iterator in place. We are really using iteration rather than an iterator patterns here.

Any other patterns?
